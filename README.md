# languageTesting

Its a custom programming language that converts .suzu files into .mjs files


Custom features :

window to create a window
label to create a label
Now requires semicolons
Require variable initialization
Require variable type
createClient makes a discord client
creatBot makes a discord bot


To setup run npm run setup and then run npm I

I am going to take this into a separate direction
Good side is that it will be updated again, and I will try making it a fully fledged language
